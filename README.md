Below you'll find sample apps written in node.js and C#. The samples offer some limited task management functionality against mock data. Each sample exercises the full richness of Microsoft Teams platform capabilities, including bots, tabs, connectors, and compose extensions. Additionally, full manifest.json examples are included to show you how to package and side load them into Teams. Feel free to use them as a starting point for your own app.
