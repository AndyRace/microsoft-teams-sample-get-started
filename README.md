# Microsoft Teams Get Started Sample
Thank you for your interest in Microsoft Teams developer samples! These samples offer some limited functionality against mock data. Each sample exercises the full richness of the Microsoft Teams platform capabilities, including bots, tabs, connectors, and compose extensions. Additionally, full manifest.json examples are included to show you how to package and side load them into Teams. 
**For more information on developing apps for Microsoft Teams, please review the Microsoft Teams [developer documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/index).**

## Sample Highlights
This app simulates connection to a project management system and allows users and teams to create, manage and search tasks. The content is randomly generated to simulate what you can do with Teams. 

* 1:1 conversation bot in a configurable tab with channel-specific simulated content
* 2 personal tabs with user-specific content
* A connector with channel-specific simulated content
* A compose extension to search channel-specific and user-specific simulated content

This repository includes code in:
* [C#](CSharp/TeamsToDoApp) 
* [Node.JS](Node/SampleApp)
