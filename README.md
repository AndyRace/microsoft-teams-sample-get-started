# Microsoft Teams Get Started Sample
Thank you for your interest in Microsoft Teams developer samples! These samples offer some limited functionality against mock data. Each sample exercises a combination of Microsoft Teams platform capabilities, including bots, tabs, connectors, and compose extensions. Additionally, full manifest.json examples are included to show you how to package and side load them into Microsoft Teams. 

**For more information on developing apps for Microsoft Teams, please review the Microsoft Teams [developer documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/index).**

## Sample Highlights

There are several different samples focusing on different combinations of capabilities:
* Sample App ([C#/.NET](CSharp/TeamsToDoApp) or [Node.js](Node/SampleApp)) shows a simulated task management SaaS, and leverages the following capapabilities:
    * Bots
    * Tabs (Configurable and Static)
    * Compose Extension
    * O365 Connectors
* Sample Notification Bot ([Node.js](Node/SampleNotificationBot)) shows a Notification only bot that illustrates how you can leverage the Bot Framework to create a Microsoft Teams-aware push notification system.
* Sample Compose Extension ([Node.js](Node/SampleCompseExtensionApp)) shows how to create a queriable service for Compose Extensions.
