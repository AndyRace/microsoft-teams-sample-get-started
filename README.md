# Microsoft Teams Sample README
Thank you for your interest in Microsoft Teams developer samples!
These samples offer some limited functionality against mock data. Each sample exercises the full richness of the Microsoft Teams platform capabilities, including bots, tabs, connectors, and compose extensions. Additionally, full manifest.json examples are included to show you how to package and side load them into Teams.
