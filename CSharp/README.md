Microsoft Teams samples offer some limited functionality against mock data. Each sample exercises the full richness of the Microsoft Teams platform capabilities, including bots, tabs, connectors, and compose extensions. Additionally, full manifest.json examples are included to show you how to package and side load them into Teams. Feel free to use them as a starting point for your own app.


#### Code Highlights
This app simulates connection to a project management system and allows users and teams to create, manage and search tasks. The content is randomly generated to simulate what you can do with Teams. 

#### What this sample shows
	• Creates 1:1 conversation bot in a configurable tab with channel-specific simulated content
	• Creates 2 personal tabs with user-specific content
	• Creates a connector with channel-specific simulated content
	• Creates a composed extension to search channel-specific and user-specific simulated content
