# Microsoft Teams Get Started Sample in C#

This app simulates connection to a project management system and allows users and teams to create, manage and search tasks. The content is randomly generated to simulate what you can do with Teams.

* An [Office 365 account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/setup)  with access to Microsoft Teams
* To view the code, you'll need the latest update of Visual Studio. You can download the community versionÂ for free from [visualstudio.com](http://www.visualstudio.com/).

## Code Walkthough
